1.The task at hand is to develop a practical solution for image
tagging by training a straightforward model. This model should
exhibit proficiency in categorizing images into elementary classes
like "cat,

" "dog,

" "car,

" etc., employing prominent libraries such as
TensorFlow or PyTorch. The overarching objective is to harness the
power of machine learning to create an effective and accessible
image classification system with real-world applicability across
various domains and use cases.
